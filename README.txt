As a passionate and results-driven Business Analyst with over 3 years of experience, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions and operational excellence. At Reliance, I have demonstrated my ability to analyze historical data, automate processes, and create predictive tools using SQL, BI platforms, VBA, and statistical models. My contributions have not only enhanced workforce productivity but also optimized service delivery, earning me recognition such as the 'Comfort Ambassador Award' for identifying and implementing innovative solutions. 

I thrive at the intersection of data, technology, and strategy. By collaborating with cross-functional teams and leveraging tools like weather APIs and statistical packages, I’ve developed impactful dashboards, improved KPIs, and created tailored business cases that align with organizational goals. My leadership extends beyond analytics—I've successfully led initiatives to boost employee engagement and foster high-performing teams, contributing to a 65% improvement in Social Capital at Brock Solutions. 

I am also adept at designing data systems, such as developing ERDs and migrating databases from Microsoft Access to SQL Server, and proposing solutions like RFPs for organizations looking to enhance their digital presence. Whether driving business transformations or giving back through volunteering initiatives, my goal is to deliver excellence and make a meaningful impact.
